# LD41

## Two Incompatible Genres

For this Ludum Dare I am attenpting to create a [Neo-noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir) [clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game), with a working title _The Big Click_.

I am continuously deploying (by delightfully committing my build artefacts!) to https://td5.github.io/LD41/.
